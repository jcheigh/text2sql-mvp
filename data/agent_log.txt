CODE DESCRIPTION: First, filter the dataframe df to include only rows where the 'usd_to_gbp' column is greater than 0.75. Then, within this filtered dataframe, calculate the ratio of 'yield_5_year' to 'yield_10_year' for each day. Identify the day with the lowest ratio. After finding the day with the lowest ratio, use the 'stock_close_usd' value for that day to calculate the EUR equivalent by multiplying with 'usd_to_eur' for the same day. Similarly, find the JPY equivalent of the 'stock_open_usd' for that day by dividing the 'stock_open_usd' value by 'usd_to_jpy' (as it's the value of 1 USD in JPY). Finally, calculate the percentage difference between the EUR equivalent of the stock close price and the JPY equivalent of the stock open price using the formula:

percentage_difference = ((eur_equivalent_close_price - jpy_equivalent_open_price) / jpy_equivalent_open_price) * 100

Note: Ensure that the date with the lowest ratio corresponds accurately to the 'usd_to_eur' and 'usd_to_jpy' values used for the conversion calculations.

CODE DESCRIPTION: To find the day with the maximum absolute difference between the 7-year and 10-year treasury yields, and then compute the requested ratio, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the absolute difference between the 7-year and 10-year treasury yields for each day in the dataframe `df`. Create a new column called 'yield_diff' to store these values.
2. Identify the day with the maximum 'yield_diff' by using the `idxmax()` function on the 'yield_diff' column. This will give you the index of the row with the highest difference.
3. Once you have the index, use it to select the row corresponding to that day from the dataframe.
4. Calculate the difference between the 'ohlc_high' and 'ohlc_low' prices for the selected day.
5. Retrieve the 'usd_to_eur' and 'usd_to_jpy' exchange rates for the selected day and calculate their product.
6. Finally, compute the ratio of the USD equivalent of the price difference (from step 4) to the product of the exchange rates (from step 5).

Ensure that you are only considering rows with complete data for all the required columns to avoid any NaN or missing value errors. Use appropriate pandas functions such as `abs()`, `idxmax()`, and arithmetic operations to perform these computations.

2. Find the row in df where 'sum_currencies' is closest to 150. This can be achieved by subtracting 150 from 'sum_currencies', taking the absolute value, and then using the `idxmin` function to get the index of the minimum value.
3. Once the row is identified, calculate the weighted average for that day. Create a new column 'weighted_average' which is calculated as follows:
   - Multiply 'open_eur_equivalent' by 'weight_eur' to get the weighted value for EUR.
   - Multiply 'close_gbp_equivalent' by 'weight_gbp' to get the weighted value for GBP.
   - Multiply 'high_jpy_equivalent' by 'weight_jpy' to get the weighted value for JPY.
   - Sum these weighted values.
   - Divide the sum of weighted values by the sum of the weights 'weight_eur', 'weight_gbp', and 'weight_jpy'.
4. Extract the 'weighted_average' for the identified row using the index found in step 2. This value is the weighted average for the day where the currency sum is closest to 150.

CODE DESCRIPTION:
Overall Goal: Identify the day with the lowest ratio of 5-year to 10-year Treasury yields for days where USD to GBP exchange rate was greater than 0.75, then calculate the percentage difference between the EUR equivalent of the stock close price and the JPY equivalent of the stock open price for that day.

Step 1: Filter df by the condition where 'usd_to_gbp' > 0.75, creating a subset dataframe called filtered_df.

Step 2: Within filtered_df, calculate a new column called 'yield_ratio' which is the ratio of 'tsy_yield_5_year' to 'tsy_yield_10_year'.

Step 3: Identify the row in filtered_df with the lowest 'yield_ratio'. Store this row's date as the variable low_yield_ratio_date.

Step 4: Using the date stored in low_yield_ratio_date, find the corresponding row in the original df to get the 'stock_close_usd', 'stock_open_usd', 'usd_to_eur', and 'usd_to_jpy' values for that date.

Step 5: Calculate the EUR equivalent of the stock close price by multiplying 'stock_close_usd' by 'usd_to_eur', and calculate the JPY equivalent of the stock open price by dividing 'stock_open_usd' by 'usd_to_jpy'.

Step 6: Compute the percentage difference between the EUR equivalent of the close price and the JPY equivalent of the open price. This is done by subtracting the JPY equivalent from the EUR equivalent, dividing by the JPY equivalent, and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

Step 7: Output the date identified in Step 3 along with the percentage difference calculated in Step 6 as the final answer.

CODE DESCRIPTION: 
Overall Goal: Identify the day with the maximum absolute difference between 7-year and 10-year treasury yields, and then calculate the ratio of the USD equivalent of the price range (difference between high and low prices) in the OHLC data to the product of USD:EUR and USD:JPY for that day.

Step 1: Extract the relevant columns from df which are 'date', 'tsy_yield_7_year', 'tsy_yield_10_year', 'ohlc_high', 'ohlc_low', 'usd_to_eur', and 'usd_to_jpy'.

Step 2: Compute a new column 'yield_diff' that represents the absolute difference between 'tsy_yield_7_year' and 'tsy_yield_10_year'.

Step 3: Identify the row/date where 'yield_diff' is maximum, which can be done using the idxmax function on the 'yield_diff' column.

Step 4: For the identified row, calculate the 'price_range' which is the difference between 'ohlc_high' and 'ohlc_low'.

Step 5: Compute the product of 'usd_to_eur' and 'usd_to_jpy' for the selected day, which will be used as a conversion factor.

Step 6: Calculate the final ratio by dividing the 'price_range' by the conversion factor obtained in the previous step.

Step 7: The result is the required ratio for the day with the maximum absolute difference between the 7-year and 10-year treasury yields.

CODE DESCRIPTION: 
Overall Goal: Find the date where the sum of usd_to_eur, usd_to_gbp, and usd_to_jpy is closest to 150 and calculate the weighted average of eur_equivalent_open, gbp_equivalent_close, and jpy_equivalent_high with the given weights for that date.

Step 1: Create a new column 'sum_of_exchanges' in df to store the sum of usd_to_eur, usd_to_gbp, and usd_to_jpy for each row.

Step 2: Find the row in df where the 'sum_of_exchanges' is closest to the target value 150. You can achieve this by subtracting 150 from the 'sum_of_exchanges' column and then taking the absolute value of the result. The row with the smallest absolute value is the row of interest.

Step 3: From the identified row, extract the values of eur_equivalent_open, gbp_equivalent_close, and jpy_equivalent_high along with their corresponding weights, weight_eur, weight_gbp, and weight_jpy.

Step 4: Calculate the weighted average for the identified row. The formula for the weighted average is:
(weight_eur * eur_equivalent_open + weight_gbp * gbp_equivalent_close + weight_jpy * jpy_equivalent_high) / (weight_eur + weight_gbp + weight_jpy).

Step 5: Return the calculated weighted average along with the date of the corresponding row. This gives the weighted average for the day where the sum of the currency exchanges was closest to 150.

CODE DESCRIPTION: 
Overall Goal: On the day where the absolute difference between 7-year treasury yield and 10-year treasury yield was maximum, compute the ratio of the USD equivalent of the difference between high and low prices in the ohlc table to the product of USD:EUR and USD:JPY for that day.

Step 1: Create a new column in df that calculates the absolute difference between the 7-year treasury yield (tsy_yield_7_year) and the 10-year treasury yield (tsy_yield_10_year) for each row.

Step 2: Identify the row with the maximum value in the newly created column (from Step 1) to find the date where the absolute difference between the 7-year and 10-year treasury yields is the greatest.

Step 3: For the identified row, calculate the difference between the high (ohlc_high) and low (ohlc_low) prices in the ohlc table to get the range of the stock prices for that day.

Step 4: For the same row, compute the product of USD to EUR (usd_to_eur) and USD to JPY (usd_to_jpy) exchange rates.

Step 5: Calculate the ratio of the USD equivalent of the price difference (from Step 3) to the product of exchange rates (from Step 4).

Note: Ensure all computations are done using the data for the same date identified in Step 2. Keep in mind that the value of the ratio might need to be adjusted depending on the units of the exchange rates provided (e.g., if the exchange rates are given in terms of how many foreign currency units one USD can buy, the ratio may need to be inverted accordingly).

CODE DESCRIPTION:
Overall Goal: Find the day where the sum of USD to EUR, USD to GBP, and USD to JPY exchange rates was closest to 150, and then calculate the weighted average of the EUR equivalent of stock_open_usd, the GBP equivalent of stock_close_usd, and the JPY equivalent of stock_high_usd using the given weights.

Step 1: Identify the relevant columns for the calculation. These are fx_usd_to_eur, fx_usd_to_gbp, fx_usd_to_jpy, stock_open_usd, stock_close_usd, stock_high_usd, weight_eur, weight_gbp, weight_jpy, and fx_date.

Step 2: Create a new column in df that is the sum of fx_usd_to_eur, fx_usd_to_gbp, and fx_usd_to_jpy for each row.

Step 3: Find the row with the sum closest to 150. This can be done by taking the absolute difference between the new sum column and 150 and finding the index of the minimum value.

Step 4: Once the row is identified, calculate the EUR equivalent of stock_open_usd by multiplying stock_open_usd with fx_usd_to_eur for the specific day.

Step 5: Calculate the GBP equivalent of stock_close_usd by multiplying stock_close_usd with fx_usd_to_gbp for the specific day.

Step 6: Calculate the JPY equivalent of stock_high_usd by multiplying stock_high_usd with fx_usd_to_jpy for the specific day.

Step 7: Calculate the final weighted average using the formula:
(weight_eur * EUR_equivalent_of_open + weight_gbp * GBP_equivalent_of_close + weight_jpy * JPY_equivalent_of_high) / (weight_eur + weight_gbp + weight_jpy).

CODE DESCRIPTION: 
Overall Goal: Identify the day where the sum of currency exchange rates (usd_to_eur, usd_to_gbp, usd_to_jpy) is closest to 150 and compute the weighted average of the EUR, GBP, and JPY equivalents (open, close, high) using the provided weights (weight_eur, weight_gbp, weight_jpy).

Step 1: Create a new column in df called 'sum_fx_rates' that is the sum of the columns 'usd_to_eur', 'usd_to_gbp', and 'usd_to_jpy'.

Step 2: Find the row in df where 'sum_fx_rates' is closest to 150. This can be done by subtracting 150 from 'sum_fx_rates' and taking the absolute value, then using the idxmin() function to find the index of the minimum value.

Step 3: Retrieve the 'weight_eur', 'weight_gbp', and 'weight_jpy' for the identified date.

Step 4: Retrieve the 'eur_equivalent_open', 'gbp_equivalent_close', and 'jpy_equivalent_high' for the identified date.

Step 5: Calculate the weighted average of the EUR, GBP, and JPY equivalents by multiplying each equivalent by its corresponding weight and then summing these products. The formula for the weighted average is:

(weight_eur * eur_equivalent_open + weight_gbp * gbp_equivalent_close + weight_jpy * jpy_equivalent_high) / (weight_eur + weight_gbp + weight_jpy)

This will give the weighted average for the day where the sum of the currency exchange rates is closest to 150.

CODE DESCRIPTION: 
Overall Goal: Find the day with the maximum absolute difference between 7-year and 10-year treasury yields, and compute the ratio of the USD equivalent of the stock price range to the product of USD:EUR and USD:JPY exchange rates for that day.
Step 1: Calculate the absolute difference between 'tsy_yield_7_year' and 'tsy_yield_10_year' columns in df and add it as a new column 'yield_diff'.
Step 2: Identify the row with the maximum value in 'yield_diff' to find the day with the maximum absolute difference.
Step 3: On the identified day, calculate the difference between 'stock_high' and 'stock_low' columns to get the stock price range.
Step 4: Multiply the stock price range by 'usd_to_eur' to convert the stock price range into EUR.
Step 5: Multiply the result from Step 4 by 'usd_to_jpy' to convert the EUR value into JPY (this gives us the USD equivalent of the price range).
Step 6: Calculate the product of the 'usd_to_eur' and 'usd_to_jpy' values for the identified day.
Step 7: Divide the USD equivalent of the price range from Step 5 by the product of exchange rates from Step 6 to get the desired ratio.
Step 8: Output the result along with the date identified in Step 2.

Note: Ensure that all operations are performed on the row corresponding to the day identified in Step 2 to maintain consistency in the calculations.

CODE DESCRIPTION: 
Overall Goal: Identify the day where the sum of the USD to EUR, GBP, and JPY rates was closest to 150, and then calculate the weighted average of the EUR equivalent of open, GBP equivalent of close, and JPY equivalent of high for that day using the given weights.

Step 1: Isolate the columns 'usd_to_eur', 'usd_to_gbp', 'usd_to_jpy', and 'fxrates_date' from the dataframe (df).

Step 2: Create a new column 'sum_of_rates' that is the sum of 'usd_to_eur', 'usd_to_gbp', and 'usd_to_jpy' for each row.

Step 3: Find the row where the 'sum_of_rates' is closest to 150. This can be achieved by subtracting 150 from 'sum_of_rates' and taking the absolute value. Then, find the index of the row with the minimum value in this new series.

Step 4: Once the row has been identified, isolate the columns 'eur_equivalent_open', 'gbp_equivalent_close', and 'jpy_equivalent_high' for this specific row.

Step 5: Isolate the 'eur_weight', 'gbp_weight', and 'jpy_weight' for the same row as identified in step 3.

Step 6: Calculate the weighted average by multiplying each of the 'eur_equivalent_open', 'gbp_equivalent_close', and 'jpy_equivalent_high' by their corresponding weights ('eur_weight', 'gbp_weight', 'jpy_weight'), summing these products, and then dividing by the sum of the weights.

Step 7: Output the date identified in step 3 and the resulting weighted average calculated in step 6 as the final answer.

CODE DESCRIPTION: 
Overall Goal: Find the day with the lowest ratio of 5-year treasury yield to 10-year treasury yield among days where USD to GBP exchange rate was greater than 0.75 and calculate the percentage difference between the EUR equivalent of the close price in USD and the JPY equivalent of the open price in USD for that day.

Step 1: Filter df to include only rows where 'usd_to_gbp' > 0.75.

Step 2: Compute a new column 'yield_ratio' as the ratio of 'yield_5y' to 'yield_10y'.

Step 3: Find the row with the minimum 'yield_ratio' computed in step 2.

Step 4: Using the row identified in step 3, calculate the EUR equivalent of the 'close_usd' by multiplying 'close_usd' with 'usd_to_eur' for the same row.

Step 5: Similarly, calculate the JPY equivalent of the 'open_usd' by dividing 'open_usd' with 'usd_to_jpy' for the same row.

Step 6: Calculate the percentage difference between the EUR equivalent of the close price and the JPY equivalent of the open price using the formula: 
\[
\text{Percentage Difference} = \left( \frac{\text{EUR equivalent of close_usd} - \text{JPY equivalent of open_usd}}{\text{JPY equivalent of open_usd}} \right) \times 100
\]

Step 7: Return the calculated percentage difference.

CODE DESCRIPTION:
Overall Goal: Identify the day with the lowest ratio of 5-year Treasury yield to 10-year Treasury yield among days where USD to GBP exchange rate was greater than 0.75, and then calculate the percentage difference between the EUR equivalent of the close price and the JPY equivalent of the open price for that specific day.

Step 1: Filter the dataframe (`df`) to include only the rows where the USD to GBP exchange rate (`fx_usd_to_gbp`) is greater than 0.75.

Step 2: Create a new column in the filtered dataframe that calculates the ratio of 5-year Treasury yield (`tsy_yield_5_year`) to 10-year Treasury yield (`tsy_yield_10_year`) for each row.

Step 3: Identify the row with the minimum ratio value from the new column created in Step 2.

Step 4: For the date identified in Step 3, extract the close price in the ohlc table (`ohlc_close`), the open price in the ohlc table (`ohlc_open`), the EUR to USD exchange rate (`fx_usd_to_eur`), and the JPY to USD exchange rate (`fx_usd_to_jpy`).

Step 5: Convert the close price from USD to EUR by dividing the close price by the EUR to USD exchange rate.

Step 6: Convert the open price from USD to JPY by multiplying the open price by the JPY to USD exchange rate.

Step 7: Calculate the percentage difference between the EUR equivalent of the close price and the JPY equivalent of the open price using the formula: `((EUR_close - JPY_open) / JPY_open) * 100`.

Step 8: Output the date identified in Step 3 and the percentage difference calculated in Step 7 as the final result.
