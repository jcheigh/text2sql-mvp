User Query:
For s in [1,2], of the days where the stock price 
    movement := close - open was more than s std deviations from the mean, look at the distribution 
    of 7yr tsy yield - 5yr tsy yield. To visualize this, assume access to matplotlib.pyplot as plt and 
    make 2 plots, the left where s = 1 and a histogram of 7yr - 5yr tsy yields with lines at 25 percentile,
    50th percentile, 75th, and then right same with s=2. Then return the median when s=1.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Calculate stock price movement by subtracting the 'stock_open' from 'stock_close' to create a new column 'stock_movement'. Then calculate the mean and standard deviation of the 'stock_movement' column. For each s in [1,2], filter the dataframe where 'stock_movement' is greater than s times the standard deviation from the mean. Create a new column 'tsy_yield_difference' by subtracting 'tsy_yield_5_year' from 'tsy_yield_7_year'. Use this filtered dataframe to calculate the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles of 'tsy_yield_difference'. Use matplotlib.pyplot (assumed as plt) to create histograms of 'tsy_yield_difference' for each s value, with vertical lines indicating the calculated percentiles. Create two subplots side by side, one for s=1 and one for s=2, with the percentile lines drawn on each. Finally, return the median value of 'tsy_yield_difference' when s=1.
