For s in [1,2], of the days where the stock price 
    movement := close - open was more than s std deviations from the mean, look at the distribution 
    of 7yr tsy yield - 5yr tsy yield. To visualize this, assume access to matplotlib.pyplot as plt and 
    make 2 plots, the left where s = 1 and a histogram of 7yr - 5yr tsy yields with lines at 25 percentile,
    50th percentile, 75th, and then right same with s=2. Then return the median when s=1.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Calculate stock price movement by subtracting the 'stock_open' from 'stock_close' to create a new column 'stock_movement'. Then calculate the mean and standard deviation of the 'stock_movement' column. For each s in [1,2], filter the dataframe where 'stock_movement' is greater than s times the standard deviation from the mean. Create a new column 'tsy_yield_difference' by subtracting 'tsy_yield_5_year' from 'tsy_yield_7_year'. Use this filtered dataframe to calculate the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles of 'tsy_yield_difference'. Use matplotlib.pyplot (assumed as plt) to create histograms of 'tsy_yield_difference' for each s value, with vertical lines indicating the calculated percentiles. Create two subplots side by side, one for s=1 and one for s=2, with the percentile lines drawn on each. Finally, return the median value of 'tsy_yield_difference' when s=1.

Overall Goal: Identify the day with the maximum absolute difference between 7-year and 10-year treasury yields, and compute the specified ratio for that day.
Step 1: Calculate the absolute difference between 'tsy_yield_7_year' and 'tsy_yield_10_year' for each row in the dataframe.
Step 2: Identify the row with the maximum absolute difference calculated in the previous step.
Step 3: For the identified day, calculate the difference between 'ohlc_high' and 'ohlc_low'.
Step 4: Convert the difference from Step 3 into USD terms by multiplying with 'usd_to_eur' and 'usd_to_jpy' for the same day to get the USD equivalent.
Step 5: Calculate the product of 'usd_to_eur' and 'usd_to_jpy' for the identified day.
Step 6: Divide the USD equivalent obtained in Step 4 by the product of the exchange rates from Step 5 to get the desired ratio.

CODE DESCRIPTION: 
Overall Goal: Identify the day where the sum of currency exchange rates (usd_to_eur, usd_to_gbp, usd_to_jpy) is closest to 150 and compute the weighted average of the EUR, GBP, and JPY equivalents (open, close, high) using the provided weights (weight_eur, weight_gbp, weight_jpy).

Step 1: Create a new column in df called 'sum_fx_rates' that is the sum of the columns 'usd_to_eur', 'usd_to_gbp', and 'usd_to_jpy'.

Step 2: Find the row in df where 'sum_fx_rates' is closest to 150. This can be done by subtracting 150 from 'sum_fx_rates' and taking the absolute value, then using the idxmin() function to find the index of the minimum value.

Step 3: Retrieve the 'weight_eur', 'weight_gbp', and 'weight_jpy' for the identified date.

Step 4: Retrieve the 'eur_equivalent_open', 'gbp_equivalent_close', and 'jpy_equivalent_high' for the identified date.

Step 5: Calculate the weighted average of the EUR, GBP, and JPY equivalents by multiplying each equivalent by its corresponding weight and then summing these products. The formula for the weighted average is:

(weight_eur * eur_equivalent_open + weight_gbp * gbp_equivalent_close + weight_jpy * jpy_equivalent_high) / (weight_eur + weight_gbp + weight_jpy)

This will give the weighted average for the day where the sum of the currency exchange rates is closest to 150.

CODE DESCRIPTION: 
Overall Goal: Find the day with the maximum absolute difference between 7-year and 10-year treasury yields, and compute the ratio of the USD equivalent of the stock price range to the product of USD:EUR and USD:JPY exchange rates for that day.
Step 1: Calculate the absolute difference between 'tsy_yield_7_year' and 'tsy_yield_10_year' columns in df and add it as a new column 'yield_diff'.
Step 2: Identify the row with the maximum value in 'yield_diff' to find the day with the maximum absolute difference.
Step 3: On the identified day, calculate the difference between 'stock_high' and 'stock_low' columns to get the stock price range.
Step 4: Multiply the stock price range by 'usd_to_eur' to convert the stock price range into EUR.
Step 5: Multiply the result from Step 4 by 'usd_to_jpy' to convert the EUR value into JPY (this gives us the USD equivalent of the price range).
Step 6: Calculate the product of the 'usd_to_eur' and 'usd_to_jpy' values for the identified day.
Step 7: Divide the USD equivalent of the price range from Step 5 by the product of exchange rates from Step 6 to get the desired ratio.
Step 8: Output the result along with the date identified in Step 2.

Note: Ensure that all operations are performed on the row corresponding to the day identified in Step 2 to maintain consistency in the calculations.

CODE DESCRIPTION: 
Overall Goal: Identify the day where the sum of the USD to EUR, GBP, and JPY rates was closest to 150, and then calculate the weighted average of the EUR equivalent of open, GBP equivalent of close, and JPY equivalent of high for that day using the given weights.

Step 1: Isolate the columns 'usd_to_eur', 'usd_to_gbp', 'usd_to_jpy', and 'fxrates_date' from the dataframe (df).

Step 2: Create a new column 'sum_of_rates' that is the sum of 'usd_to_eur', 'usd_to_gbp', and 'usd_to_jpy' for each row.

Step 3: Find the row where the 'sum_of_rates' is closest to 150. This can be achieved by subtracting 150 from 'sum_of_rates' and taking the absolute value. Then, find the index of the row with the minimum value in this new series.

Step 4: Once the row has been identified, isolate the columns 'eur_equivalent_open', 'gbp_equivalent_close', and 'jpy_equivalent_high' for this specific row.

Step 5: Isolate the 'eur_weight', 'gbp_weight', and 'jpy_weight' for the same row as identified in step 3.

Step 6: Calculate the weighted average by multiplying each of the 'eur_equivalent_open', 'gbp_equivalent_close', and 'jpy_equivalent_high' by their corresponding weights ('eur_weight', 'gbp_weight', 'jpy_weight'), summing these products, and then dividing by the sum of the weights.

Step 7: Output the date identified in step 3 and the resulting weighted average calculated in step 6 as the final answer.
